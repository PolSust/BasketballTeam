# BasketballTeam
## Mobile application created in 1 week using Angular, Ionic and FireBase

This is an app created for a fictional basketball team.

Featuring an admin control pannel where you can create Matches and Accounts so the players of the team can check on their phones if there are any new matches coming soon.


**WHAT I'VE LEARNED:**

* How to correctly user Angular Guards 
* I got a better understanding of how to use Firebase 
* How to create an searchbar with auto completion using data from an API
* And a better understanding of both Promises and Observables
